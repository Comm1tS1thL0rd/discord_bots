# discord_bots

A collection of all my Discord bots built for Discord. This repository serves as a central hub for my Discord automation projects, ranging from moderation tools to utility and entertainment bots.

## 🚀 About

This repo is where I will publish every Discord bot I create. Each bot is organized in its own folder with source code, documentation, and usage instructions. Most bots are written in Python using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library, but I may experiment with other languages and frameworks in the future.

---

### Each bot folder contains:
- Source code
- Feature list
- Example usage
- ~~My Discord Bot Token~~

## 🤖 Bots Included

- **BITS Pilani Goa Discord Bot**  
  Automates student verification and role assignment for BITS Goa campus Discord servers.

*(Will add more as I make them!)*

## 🛠️ Technologies
